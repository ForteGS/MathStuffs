    \item[Problem 6.6:] Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a < b$. Prove $\exists s \notin \mathbb{Q}$ such that $a < s < b$.
        \begin{proof}
            Assume $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a < b$. Assume $c, d \in \mathbb{R}$ so that $c = \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}$ and $d = \frac{b}{\sqrt{2}}$. Since $a < b$, $c < d$. By the Density theorem, we know $\exists q \in \mathbb{Q}$ so that $c < q < d$. So we have
            \begin{gather*}
                c < q < d\\
                \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}} < q < \frac{b}{\sqrt{2}}\\
                a < q\sqrt{2} < b
            \end{gather*}
            But $q\sqrt{2} \in \mathbb{R}$. So for $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$, $\exists s \notin \mathbb{Q}$ such that $a < s < b$.
        \end{proof}
    \item[Problem 6.7:] Prove if $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$, with $a < b$, then $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$, there are numbers $x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n-1}, x_n \in \mathbb{Q}$ all different so that for all $i = 1, 2, 3, ..., n$, we have $a < x_i < b$.
        \begin{proof}
            Assume $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ with $a < b$. We will prove the above statement using induction on $n$. We will need to prove two claims.
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item[1.] We want to show: If $n = 1$, then if $\exists x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \in \mathbb{Q}$ all different so that for all $i = 1, 2, 3, ..., n$, we have $a < x_i < b$.\\
                    Assume $n = 1$. Assume $\exists x_1, ..., x_n \in \mathbb{Q}$ all different. Since $n = 1$, $\exists x_1 \in \mathbb{Q}$. Since $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$, by the Density theorem, $\exists q \in \mathbb{Q}$ so that $a < q < b$. Let $q = x_1$ and so $a < x_1 < b$.\\
                    So we have shown that for $n = 1$, if $\exists x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \in \mathbb{Q}$ all different so that for all $i = 1, 2, 3, ..., n$, we have $a < x_i < b$.
                \item[2.] We also want to show: If for $n = n_0$, if $\exists x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \in \mathbb{Q}$ all different so that for all $i = 1, 2, 3, ..., n$, we have $a < x_i < b$, then for $n = n_0 + 1$, if $\exists x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \in \mathbb{Q}$ all different so that for all $i = 1, 2, 3, ..., n$, we have $a < x_i < b$.\\
                    Assume $n = n_0$. Assume $\exists x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \in \mathbb{Q}$ so that for all $i = 1, 2, 3, ..., n$, we have $a < x_i < b$. Our inductive hypothesis says $\exists x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n_0} \in \mathbb{Q}$ so that for all $i = 1, 2, 3, ..., n$, we have $a < x_i < b$. Consider $a < x_{n_0} < b$. Since $x_{n_0} \in \mathbb{Q}$, it has to be in $\mathbb{R}$. So $x_{n_0} \in \mathbb{R}$. We also know $b \in \mathbb{R}$ and $b > x_{n_0}$ by our inductive hypothesis.
                    So then by the Density theorem, $\exists x_{n_0 + 1} \in \mathbb{Q}$ so that $x_{n_0} < x_{n_0 + 1} < b$. So then for all $i = 1, 2, ..., n_0, n_0 + 1$, we have $a < x_i < b$.
            \end{enumerate}
            Proving claim (1) and claim (2) thus completes the proof by induction on $n$.
        \end{proof}
