\begin{theorem}
    All horses have the same color.
    \begin{proof}
        Since the number of horses is a natural number, let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ be the number of horses. We proceed proving the above claim using induction on $n$. We need to prove 2 claims.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item[1.] If $n = 1$, then all horses have the same color.
            \item[] Assume $n = 1$. So we have 1 horse. This means the group of 1 horse have the same color, which is true by default.
            \item[2.] If a group of $n_0$ horses have the same color, then a group of $n_0 + 1$ horses have the same color.
            \item[] Assume $n_0$ horses have the same color. 
                We number these horses accordingly.
                \begin{equation*}
                    1, 2, 3, ..., n_0 \text{ have the same color }
                \end{equation*}

                By our inductive hypothesis, $n_0$ horses have the same color. So then for
                \begin{equation*}
                    2, 3, 4, ..., n_0 + 1
                \end{equation*}
                these horses have the same color.\\
                So we can conclude the horses from
                \begin{equation*}
                    1, 2, 3, 4, ..., n_0, n_0 + 1
                \end{equation*}
                have the same color.
        \end{enumerate}
        Thus, all horses have the same color by induction on $n$.
    \end{proof}
\end{theorem}
